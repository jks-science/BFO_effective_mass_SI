# Effective mass in BiFeO<sub>3</sub>: SI
Supplementary material for our study on factors influencing effective mass in BiFeO3.

[VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) and [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) were used to study the structural factors influencing charge carrier effective mass in bismuth ferrite. 
Here we present the raw data, together with some of the analysis and a range of supplementary results contained in a Jupyter notebook.

Github can render the notebook, but [nbviewer may do a better job of it](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jks-science/BFO_effective_mass_SI/blob/master/BFO_effectivemass_SI.ipynb).
